<h1>Best Movies according to Parth</h1>
<h2>Best animated movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Cars</h3>
<p>Cars was the movies franchise that got me interested in animated movies. The story is great.
    The animation has aged like fine wine</p>

<h3>The lego movie</h3>
<p>The LEGO movie inspired what can be created from legos and stretched bounds of animation mixing cgi, and stop motion animation</p>

<h3>Spider Man: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Spiderman into the spiderman just created a new form of animation, with all the comics, and smudging effects. It was an entirely new concpet and it worked wonders.</p>
